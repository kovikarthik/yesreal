      Recruitment Classifieds & Related Services
      <br /><br /> This is the company's flagship brand and India's largest online job website. Its business model depends on job listings and employer branding or visibility advertisements, on the one hand, and résumé database access, on the other. Additional features of the website include: job seeker services such as candidate services which are free for job seekers; value-added features such as resume writing, highlighting, etc., for job seekers; and tools to search the database of resumes and job application screening programs for employer and recruitment consultant customers. Google Ad sense and mobile revenues contribute to the revenue as well.

      <br /><br /> As of March 31, 2016, naukri.com had a database of about 46 million registered job seekers and an average of about 12,000 résumés were added daily while about 195,000 resumes were modified daily during Q4 FY 2015-16 and 61,000 unique corporate customers (including hiring consultants/firms) availed of services such as database access, advertising/listing on the site, amongst others during the 2015-16. The website continued to gain market share in terms of user traffic.

      <br /><br /> To retain its leadership position, the company constantly invests in product development and improved user experiences through search tools and better site response. The search mechanism has been significantly improved for job search. The online platform is supplemented by a mobile application for iOS and Android platforms. The mobile medium is continually gaining traction. The cloud SaaS-based career site manager is now being used by 1,600 clients and helps them manage process flow of applications for recruiters, and is used to launch mobile ready career sites at a fraction of cost. It includes an application tracking system. The referral hiring platform is now being used by 350 corporates.

      <br /><br /> Going forward, the vision is to reposition naukri.com as a complete recruitment partner by consolidating all products into a Naukri Hiring Suite that caters to almost all the recruitment needs of customers.
