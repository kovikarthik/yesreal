      <h4>YRT - TRUSTED EMPLOYEE BACKGROUND VERIFICATION COMPANY</h4><hr />

        <div style={{ margin:'2rem',marginTop: '0rem' }}>
        Yrt is an end-to-end Background Verification Company in India that specializes in establishing trust in an individual or company through rigorous and automated background check processes in the shortest possible time using strict data security protocols. 

        We live in a trust-deficit society, and Yrt envisions a world where people can safely meet and socialize because we have verified them or enabled them to verify each other. We help our clients gain enough data and evidence to make smarter, human-centered decisions.

        As one of the leading employee background verification companies in India, Yrt aims to prevent easily avoidable fraud for businesses and also for the most vulnerable sections of society. We believe that people should not just contact each other on a whim, especially for business. We also believe that people are generally not capable of firstly discovering deep insights from huge data sources (related to individuals) and secondly deciphering them themselves.

        That is why we have developed background verification and fraud prevention products/solutions for corporations, financial institutions, and the common man/woman at large. We have offices in Bangalore, Pune & Dehradun and we also have a pan-India presence of verification officers which enables us to cover all zip codes.
